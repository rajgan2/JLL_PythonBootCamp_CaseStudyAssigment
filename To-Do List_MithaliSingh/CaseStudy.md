Case Study:
Building a Simple To-Do List Application Background:
You have been hired by a small startup to develop a basic to-do list application using Python.

The application should allow users to create, view, update, and delete tasks in their to-do list.

Objective:
Design and implement a simple to-do list application using Python that allows users to manage their tasks effectively.

Requirements:

1.  Task Management: The application should provide the following functionalities:

    1. Add a new task with a title and description.
    2. View all tasks in the to-do list
    3. Update the details of a task (title and/or description).
    4. Delete a task from the list.

2.  Data Storage: Use a simple data storage mechanism to save the tasks, such as a list or a text file.

3.  User Interaction: Implement a user-friendly text-based interface to interact with the application.

    1.  Use the console (command-line interface) to display the options and receive user input.

4.  Task Persistence: Ensure that tasks added to the to-do list are saved and can be retrieved even after closing and reopening the application.

5.  Error Handling: Implement appropriate error handling to handle invalid inputs and edge cases, preventing the application from crashing.

6.  Clear Documentation: Provide clear and concise documentation for your code, explaining the purpose and functionality of each function and class.

7.  Bonus (Optional):
    1.  Add a due date to each task and allow users to sort tasks based on due dates.
    2.  Implement a way to mark tasks as completed or add a priority level to tasks.

Submission:
Submit a well-documented Python script or Jupyter notebook that contains the code for your to-do list application.
Include instructions on how to run the application and a brief explanation of the code's logic.
Note:
This case study is meant to be a simple exercise to showcase your understanding of basic Python programming and data management.
Focus on creating clean and functional code while addressing the core requirements.
